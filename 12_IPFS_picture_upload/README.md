# IPFS demo - image uploading

This is a simple example which demostrates image uploading to IPFS.

The example shows you the IPFS hash and the length of base64 encoded image. You will notice that there's a huge difference regarding to the size of both strings. You definately don't want to store the based64 encoded data to smart contract (and you probably can't because it's too big)
